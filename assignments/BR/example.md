# Examples and Commentary

We provide two examples of video book trailers and a link to commentary below. The two video book trailers come from undergraduate literature courses. The commentary video offers insights into the process of creating these kinds pieces and the learning experienced.

[The Giver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr16t3ieApE) This book trailer previews Lois Lowry's classic book The Giver. Using a popular music sample as a sound track, the video mixes images and text to provide insights into the book. It opens with background information on the book and author, and then moves through visuals and short bits of text to allude to key themes.

[Powerful Moments](https://vimeo.com/334425294) This piece entices viewers to read the graphic novel, Watchmen. In this example, the author uses a tall format so that the video can be shared through social media channels like Instagram Stories. The format allows the author to arrange images and text simultaneously over the video canvas.

You can get a sense of some means of assessing these kinds of piecers by watching [this comment video](https://vimeo.com/332460945) which walks viewers through the main components of the video book trailer on The Giver.
