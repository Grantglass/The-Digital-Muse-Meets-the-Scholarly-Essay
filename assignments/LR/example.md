## Book Cover Rubric (Think about Summary, Quotes and Design)

1.Content
2.Structure
3. Style 

What does an A look like?
Summary is engaging, but not too revealing--includes a “cliffhanger.” The summary makes you want to read the book. The summary is informative without being heavy handed; it is meant to increase the potential reader’s interest, not just tell them the plot in its entirety.
If images are used, the pictures are of good quality. Images are both interesting and indicative of the nature of the book. Picture on front cover is not too busy whether that be with the wording or colors.
All text is clearly visible and doesn’t disrupt the image on the cover.
Cover design overall makes you interested and wanting to read the book.  
The cover is professional looking. 
Quotes are concise, interesting and add to the cover. 
The front and back of the cover “flow” and work together
Attention drawn to title
Book review excerpts sound appealing 

What does a B look like?
Bad picture quality
Summary on back cover has some grammar/spelling errors
Cover is too “busy”
Cover design is interesting but not as compelling as it could be
Summary reveals too much, “book report” like.
The quotes raise an interest in the book without being compelling
Distractions on the cover.. If quote/tagline isn’t relevant, if picture is too busy, etc.
Summary tells the entire plot of a novel.

What does a C or revise look like?
Not on time
Summary is not accurate
Picture doesn’t relate to the summary/plot of the book
Front and back covers do not work together
Quotes are not attributed to anyone or any publications
Resources are from goodreads, amazon, etc (not vetted sources) 




# Commentaries

Book Cover 1 (Fight Club):

The design is very good here. I like that you have differentiated the quotes on the back cover. Your summary is very strong and creative. I think the second paragraph just has some edits I would make. First, I would delte/change “After graduating from the University of Oregon, Palahniuk began his career writing short stories.” I don’t think this adds to the biography.  Also, I would be careful not to begin two sentences in a row with “this.”

Book Cover 2 

Front Cover: I like the concept here! I wouldn’t use a quote on this front cover (and FYI it is a Book, not “Bok”). It might be the exporting here, but the title is hard to read against this cover and the author’s name is impossible to see. I would use a map that seems a little more worn or something vintage looking (like https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/59/4a/a4/594aa46ba7a214800f0fd3c03188833e.jpg). I think it might work well to have the map span the back and the front, so the journey becomes the focus on the total cover.

Spine:  I like this color you selected, I think it works well. The line between the title and the author is a little off.

Back: I like that you put an image back here. I would only suggest trying to use an image of Cheryl Strayed rather than one from the movie. If you do a map throughout, I don’t think you would need an image back here at all. 
The summary is good overall and I can see why you wanted to put an image back there, it does feel a little text heavy. I would just delete the third paragraph. I think the first two are enough here.



Book Cover 3:

Excellent work! The only two things I have for you would be to try to have a different picture on the spine or try to lighten the color on the spine, it seems to separate from the front cover too much. The second, is using “THE” or “The” on the front quote; I am not sure if that was intentional or not. The letters are distracting, so if it is in all caps then I would try to just format it “the.”

Book Cover 4:

Love this design!! Very good. The back feels a little text heavy, I wonder if you just use two quotes instead of three? Or move one to the front cover? Other than that this is perfect!
Great work.
