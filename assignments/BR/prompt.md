# **Video Essay**
 

>“There are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.”

-Charles Dickens, *Oliver Twist*

For this unit, you will take on the role of a Public History student who has been tasked with surveying, researching, and analyzing one specific building at UNC Chapel Hill. The end product is a compelling video essay that will inform and enlighten the greater university community about the buildings they spend so much time in. Much like the outstanding films of Ken Burns, your 3-5-minute video will incorporate images (photographs, maps) and narration (words), but will not need to include shot video (unless you would like to).

## Feeder 1-  Video Narrative 

 

The driving force of the video will be the narrative of the book, which should be an engaging, illustrated interpretive story (about 200 words) about the plot of your book. This should open with an interesting “hook” to draw people in, have a discernable thesis statement or overarching point, and present a concise, contextualized, compelling narrative about your book.

Major points you should touch on:

What’s the book's story about?
Be sure to include basic information about your book (author, when it was published, genre, publisher).
What is/are the general context(s) we need to know about to understand your book?
Who are the major characters?
Where/When is the book set?



Feeder 2- Storyboard


This is where all the work you have done in the feeders comes together. Now it is your turn to become the filmmaker. You will want to think about how the images will work with your text. 

 First, you will record your narrative which will serve as your base of the video. Practice makes perfect, so think about how you want your voice to sound and do a few trial runs. One option to record your voice is the [Media Resources Center](https://library.unc.edu/house/mrc/), which will provide you the tools to create a professional quality recording. You can also use your own microphone or phone if you would like, but be cognizent of the audio quality.

 
Second, you will create a visual component by choosing specific images of your book or images relating to your book and forming a video from these media. You may also choose to place text over or between your images. When choosing images, ensure you are using stock photographs,  Creative Commons licensed images, or  images that are labeled for reuse. Please consult the [library's guide to images](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/ImagesReuse/images)






Final Project- Video Essay 

This is where all the work you have done in the feeders comes together. Now it is your turn to become the filmmaker. You will want to think about how the images will work with your narrative and if you want to include any text (words) in your movie. We will be using Adobe Premier to create our video, a quick tutorial can be found here (http://guides.lib.unc.edu/mrc/adobepremiere). We will have Greg from the Undergraduate Library to show us how to use this software.
