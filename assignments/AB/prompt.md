Moving Images Prompt

Use Adobe Photoshop (or an alternative image editor) to explore the ways that words and images can be mixed to create messages with immediate impact. This assignment will help you understand the power of both words and images when distilled down to essential, economical components. The project also invites you to think critically about aspects of internet culture, particularly the spread of viral images. The tasks also require that you develop literacies for working with visual editors, including working with layers and selecting and masking visual elements. As you become familiar with these moves, you will also think through a number of visual and design strategies. Finally, this activity requires that you develop fluency with capturing and quickly editing video that can be repurposed to create animated GIFs

You will start by becoming familiar with two intellectual concerns: viral images and visual rhetoric. You will then move on to composing your own animated GIFs using video and image editing.

Feeder 1: Understanding Viral Images 

To get started, explore this [study on predicting the success of memes](https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0376/paper0376.pdf). As you read, think about critiques that associate the internet with soundbite culture and the decline of literacy. How might the conclusions of the article inform these debates? After you have thought about the spread of viral images, look over [this article related to wordplay](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/your-pun-divided-attention-how-the-brain-processes-wordplay/) As you read, revisit your thinking about critiques of internet culture. How might aspects related to wordplay inform these debates?

You can conduct additional research online into viral images or playful language. Once you have a good sense of some of the characteristics of viral images, complete these tasks: Search online through sites containing viral images and other memes. Identify one image that includes wordplay, and copy its web address. Submit a posting providing the address of the image and a one- to two-paragraph analysis. In the analysis, explore aspects of the image that might contribute to its likelihood of becoming viral. Finally, offer some conclusions about what the image suggests about internet culture and composing visuals designed to create instant impact. 

Feeder 2: Understanding Visual Rhetoric

First, look over [this blog posting](https://blog.adobespark.com/2016/07/27/8-basic-design-principles-to-help-you-create-better-graphics/) to become familiar with some basic components of graphic design. Also, look over [this article focusing on emphasis](https://www.sophia.org/tutorials/design-in-art-emphasis-variety-and-unity). Next, explore this [article on the importance of contrast] (https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/creative-professional/just-black-white-using-contrast-get-attention-graphic-designs. You can explore other concepts of design as you work through these materials or conduct additional research later as you submit the feeder assignment.

Next, search online for viral images and identify several items: choose 1) an image that features principles of emphasis, 2) an image that features principles of contrast, and 3) an image that makes use of one additional design priciple. (Conduct additional research into design principles if needed.) Copy the web addresses of these images, and then submit a posting providing the address for the first image. Compose a few sentences describing the image's use of emphasis. Repeat the process for the image featuring contrast. And complete the posting by providing the address of the third image and discussing the design principle you have identified for it.
