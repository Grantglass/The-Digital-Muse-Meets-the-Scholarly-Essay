Moving Images Prompt

Use Adobe Photoshop (or an alternative image editor) to explore the ways that words and images can be mixed to create messages with immediate impact. This assignment will help you understand the power of both words and images when distilled down to essential, economical components. The project also invites you to think critically about aspects of internet culture, particularly the spread of viral images. The tasks also require that you develop literacies for working with visual editors, including working with layers and selecting and masking visual elements. As you become familiar with these moves, you will also think through a number of visual and design strategies. Finally, this activity requires that you develop fluency with capturing and quickly editing video that can be repurposed to create animated GIFs

You will start by becoming familiar with two intellectual concerns: viral images and visual rhetoric. You will then move on to composing your own animated GIFs using video and image editing.

Feeder 1: Understanding viral images and visual rhetoric

To get started, explore this [study on predicting the success of memes](https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0376/paper0376.pdf). As you read, think about critiques that associate the internet with soundbite culture and the decline of literacy. How might the conclusions of the article inform these debates?

Next, look over [this blog posting](https://blog.adobespark.com/2016/07/27/8-basic-design-principles-to-help-you-create-better-graphics/) to become familiar with some basic components of graphic design. Also, look over [this article focusing on emphasis](https://www.sophia.org/tutorials/design-in-art-emphasis-variety-and-unity). 

You can conduct additional research online into viral images and graphic design. Once you have a good sense of some of the characteristics of viral images and of design concepts like contrast and emphasis, complete these tasks: Search online through sites containing viral images and other memes. Identify one image, and copy its web address. Submit a posting providing the address of the image and a two-paragraph analysis. In the analysis, explore aspects of the image that might contribute to its likelihood of becoming viral. Also explore strategies of graphic design that might be present in the image. Finally, offer some conclusions about what the image suggests about internet culture and composing visuals designed to create instant impact.
