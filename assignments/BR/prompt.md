Video Essay
 

“You can’t possibly know where you are or where you’re going if you don’t know where you’ve been.”

-Ken Burns

For our second unit, you will take on the role of a Public History student who has been tasked with surveying, researching, and analyzing one specific building at UNC Chapel Hill. The end product is a compelling video essay that will inform and enlighten the greater university community about the buildings they spend so much time in. Much like the outstanding films of Ken Burns, your 3-5-minute video will incorporate images (photographs, maps) and narration (words), but will not need to include shot video (unless you would like to).

Feeder 1-  Building Narrative 

 

The driving force of the video will be the narrative of the building which should be an engaging, illustrated interpretive article (about 500 words) about the history of your main building. This should open with an interesting “hook” to draw people in, have a discernable thesis statement or overarching point, and present a concise, contextualized, compelling narrative about your building.

Major points you should touch on:

What’s the building’s interesting historical “story”?
Be sure to include basic information about your building (when built and why, original purpose, location, original use, present use, anything notable about design, architecture, construction).
What is/are the general historical context(s) we need to know about to understand your building and/or its namesake?
Discuss change over time. Utilize the findings from your surveys.
What can be said about controversies or conflicts or major decision points over/around/related to this building?
Note: If you use any primary or secondary sources they must be cited and you must include a references section (this will not be included in your 500 words).

 

Feeder 2- Storyboard






Final Project- Video Essay 

This is where all the work you have done in the feeders comes together. Now it is your turn to become the filmmaker. You will want to think about how the images will work with your narrative and if you want to include any text (words) in your movie. We will be using Adobe Premier to create our video, a quick tutorial can be found here (http://guides.lib.unc.edu/mrc/adobepremiere). We will have Greg from the Undergraduate Library to show us how to use this software.

First, you will record your narrative which will serve as your base of the video. Practice makes perfect, so think about how you want your voice to sound and do a few trial runs. One option to record your voice is the Media Resources Center (https://library.unc.edu/house/mrc/) , which will provide you the tools to create a professional quality recording. You can also use your own microphone or phone if you would like.

Second, you will create a visual component by choosing specific images of your building and forming a video from these images. You may also choose to place text over or between your images. The end result will be a 4-5 minute video that you will upload to Sakai dropbox.
