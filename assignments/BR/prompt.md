# **Book Review (Trailer in Rush)**
 

>“There are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.”

-Charles Dickens, *Oliver Twist*

For this unit, you will take on the role of an Editorial Intern at a publishing house that has been tasked with creating an engaging book review of a title that has fallen out of favor. Since the publisher is trying to reach new audiences, they want you to create a one-minute video that will both inform and generate interest in your assigned title.

| Book Review Video | Summarize and publicize a text of provided by your publishing house. | Publishing House | Editorial Intern | You have approached a publishing house about assisting with a marketing campaign for one of its books. While this particular book is interesting, it is not selling well. Your assignment is to come up with a 60 second video trailer for that book to help it sell more copies. |


## Feeder 1- Narrative 

 

The driving force of the video will be a narrative, an engaging, illustrated interpretive story (about 200 words) that captures the events and key elements of the book. This should open with an interesting “hook” to draw people in, have a discernable thesis statement or overarching point, and present a concise, contextualized, compelling narrative about your book.

Major points you should touch on:

What’s the book's story about?
Be sure to include basic information about your book (author, when it was published, genre, publisher).
What is/are the general context(s) we need to know about to understand your book?
Who are the major characters?
Where/When is the book set?



## Feeder 2- Storyboard

Next, you will create a storyboard of the visual components of your video by choosing specific images of your book or images relating to your book. You may also choose to place text over or between your images; please notate that on your storyboard. When choosing images, ensure you are using stock photographs,  Creative Commons licensed images, or  images that are labeled for reuse. Please consult the [library's guide to images](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/ImagesReuse/images) for more information.

Once you have all your visual components that you want to include, the next step is to break up your narrative into chunks of text under each image in your storyboard, so you know what [missing information]






## Final Project- Video Trailer 

This is where all the work you have done in the feeders comes together. Now it is your turn to become the filmmaker. You will want to think about how the images will work with your narrative and if you want to include any text (words) in your movie. A simple path is to use [Adobe Premier Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html) to create the video, but you can use other video editors if you prefer. 

First, you will record your narrative (from Feeder1) which will serve as the base of the video. Practice makes perfect, so think about how you want your voice to sound and do a few trial runs. One option to record your voice is the [Media Resources Center](https://library.unc.edu/house/mrc/) , which will provide you the tools to create a professional quality recording. You can also use your own microphone or phone if you would like.

Once you have all your visual components that you want to include from your Feeder 2, the next step is to break up your narrative into chunks of text under each image in your storyboard, so you know what portions of the narrative will align to the text being spoken.

Finally, once all of your media are together and polished, you will export your video and submit it.
