# **Book Review (Trailer in Rush)**
 

>“There are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.”

-Charles Dickens, *Oliver Twist*

For this unit, you will take on the role of a Public History student who has been tasked with surveying, researching, and analyzing one specific building at UNC Chapel Hill. The end product is a compelling video essay that will inform and enlighten the greater university community about the buildings they spend so much time in. Much like the outstanding films of Ken Burns, your 3-5-minute video will incorporate images (photographs, maps) and narration (words), but will not need to include shot video (unless you would like to).

| Book Review Video | Summarize and publicize a text of provided by your publishing house. | Publishing House | Editorial Intern | You have approached a publishing house about assisting with a marketing campaign for one of its books.

## Feeder 1- Narrative 

 

The driving force of the video will be the narrative of the book, which should be an engaging, illustrated interpretive story (about 200 words) about the plot of your book. This should open with an interesting “hook” to draw people in, have a discernable thesis statement or overarching point, and present a concise, contextualized, compelling narrative about your book.

Major points you should touch on:

What’s the book's story about?
Be sure to include basic information about your book (author, when it was published, genre, publisher).
What is/are the general context(s) we need to know about to understand your book?
Who are the major characters?
Where/When is the book set?



## Feeder 2- Storyboard

Next, you will create a storyboard by finding the visual components to your video by choosing specific images of your book or images relating to your book. You may also choose to place text over or between your images, please notate that on your storyboard. When choosing images, ensure you are using stock photographs,  Creative Commons licensed images, or  images that are labeled for reuse. Please consult the [library's guide to images](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/ImagesReuse/images) for more information.

Once you have all your visual components that you want to include, the next step is to break up your narrative into chunks of text under each image in your storyboard, so you know what 






## Final Project- Video Trailer 

This is where all the work you have done in the feeders comes together. Now it is your turn to become the filmmaker. You will want to think about how the images will work with your narrative and if you want to include any text (words) in your movie. We will be using [Adobe Premier Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html) to create our video. 

First, you will record your narrative (from Feeder1) which will serve as your base of the video. Practice makes perfect, so think about how you want your voice to sound and do a few trial runs. One option to record your voice is the [Media Resources Center](https://library.unc.edu/house/mrc/) , which will provide you the tools to create a professional quality recording. You can also use your own microphone or phone if you would like.

Once you have all your visual components that you want to include from your Feeder 2, the next step is to break up your narrative into chunks of text under each image in your storyboard, so you know what portions of the narrative will align to the text being spoken.

Finally, once all of your media are together and polished, you will export your video and send it off.
